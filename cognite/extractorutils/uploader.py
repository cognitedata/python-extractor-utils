"""
Module containing upload queue classes. The UploadQueue classes chunks together items and uploads them together to CDF,
both to minimize the load on the API, and also to speed up uploading as requests can be slow.

Each upload queue comes with some configurable conditions that, when met, automatically triggers an upload.

**Note:** You cannot assume that an element is uploaded when it is added to the queue, since the upload may be
delayed. To ensure that everything is uploaded you should set the `post_upload_function` callback to verify. For
example, for a time series queue you might want to check the latest time stamp, as such (assuming incremental time
stamps and using timestamp-value tuples as data point format):


.. code-block:: python

    state_store = LocalStateStore("states.json")

    queue = TimeSeriesUploadQueue(
        cdf_client=my_cognite_client,
        post_upload_function=state_store.post_upload_handler(),
        max_upload_interval=1
    )
