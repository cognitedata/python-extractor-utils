"""
The ``statestore`` module contains classes for keeping track of the extraction state of individual items, facilitating
incremental load and speeding up startup times.

At the beginning of a run the extractor typically calls the ``initialize`` method, which loads the states from the
remote store (which can either be a local JSON file or a table in CDF RAW), and during and/or at the end of a run, the
``synchronize`` method is called, which saves the current states to the remote store.
