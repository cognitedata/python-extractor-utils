### Contributing

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage dependencies and to administrate virtual environments. To develop
`extractor-utils`, follow the following steps to set up your local environment:

 1. Install poetry: (add `--user` if desirable)
    ```
    $ pip install poetry
    ```
 2. Clone repository:
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:cognitedata/python-extractor-utils.git
    ```
 3. Move into the newly created local repository:
    ```
    $ cd python-extractor-utils
    ```
 4. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```
    $ poetry install
    ```

All code must pass [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) and [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) style
checks to be merged. It is recommended to install pre-commit hooks to ensure this locally before commiting code:

```
$ poetry run pre-commit install
```
